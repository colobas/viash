viash helps you turn a script (Bash/R/Python/Scala/JavaScript) into a reusable component. 
By providing some meta-data regarding its functionality and
the platform on which you want to run the software, viash can help you:

* wrap your script in an executable with a CLI and --help functionality,
* seamlessly execute your component natively on the host platform or in a Docker container
* combine multiple components in a Nextflow pipeline, and
* unit-test your component to ensure that it works at all times.
